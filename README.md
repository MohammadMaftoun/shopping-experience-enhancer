This repository contains the code and documentation for an expandable recommender system tailored for an e-commerce store. The system utilizes various techniques, including data cleansing, data visualization, the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model with score, and clustering algorithms. It aims to provide personalized recommendations to users, enhancing their shopping experience and improving conversion rates.

## Features

- **Data Cleansing**: Implement data preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality, handle missing values, remove outliers, and normalize the data for further analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize visualization techniques to gain insights into the e-commerce data, understand customer behavior, identify trends, and support decision-making processes.
- **RFM Model with Score**: Calculate RFM scores for customers based on their purchase recency, frequency, and monetary value, providing a quantitative measure to segment and target customers effectively.
- **Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to group similar customers together, enabling personalized recommendations by identifying patterns and preferences within different customer segments.

## Getting Started

To get started with the recommender system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MohammadMaftoun/shopping-experience-enhancer.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare the e-commerce dataset for analysis by performing data cleansing techniques.
4. Visualize the data using various plots and charts to gain insights into customer behavior.
5. Utilize the RFM model to calculate scores for customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.
6. Apply clustering algorithms to identify customer segments and their preferences.
7. Expand the system by adding additional modules or techniques to enhance the recommendations further.
